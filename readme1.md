# Jacob Williams 51 - Final Site - Ideation (Concept & Planning)

For my final website, I'm just gonna do something simple, a personal website talking about my experiences throughout this web-development class.  My Home page will just show the website title, the navigation bar, and some parallax images to help get the viewer interested.  As for my other pages; I am going to have an About page that obviously tells what the website is about (what I learned throughout the course mainly), a Contact page that'll show my contact information (email, phone #, etc.) and a Project Gallery page that will have images of my past homework projects that will also serve as links that take the viewer straight to them.  My navigation bar will feature links to; Home, About, Contact, and the Gallery section will have a dropdown menu that will have a few links to certain projects and the Project Gallery page in general.  I will have a little more information released when I have to turn in my wireframe sketches, but I think that my site map will also help explain my ideas.
